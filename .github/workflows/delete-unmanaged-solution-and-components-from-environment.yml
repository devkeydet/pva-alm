# This pipeline gets triggered manually or via an API call.
# It is a general purpose automation that allows you to delete or "clean up" an unmanaged solution from a Dataverse environment.
# It is a destructive action and will remove everything in the solution from the environment.
# If there are dependencies in other solutions on components in the solution you are trying to clean up / delete, the pipeline will fail.
# You need to clean up dependencies before running this pipeline.
