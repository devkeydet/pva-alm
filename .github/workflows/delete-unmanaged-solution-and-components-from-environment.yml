# This pipeline gets triggered manually or via an API call.  
# It is a general purpose automation that allows you to delete or "clean up" an unmanaged solution from a Dataverse environment.
# It is a destructive action and will remove everything in the solution from the environment.
# If there are dependencies in other solutions on components in the solution you are trying to clean up / delete, the pipeline will fail.
# You need to clean up dependencies before running this pipeline.

# If the import failed, we can't continue with the cleanup process. 
# A common cause of this is that a canvas app is still open in the studio and therefore import is blocked.
# To accomodate for import failures, we separate into two stages so we can rerun the import stage if it fails.
# This gives the maker an opportunity to resolve the issue, and rerun the second stage which will try to import/delete the managed solution again.
# Maker can continute to rerun the stage (trial/error) until there are no more import errors.
